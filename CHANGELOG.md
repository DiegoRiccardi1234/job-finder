# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.6] — 2026-07-22

Scores you can act on: offers you legally can't take stop outranking the ones you can, and the app stops burning its daily quota on models that never answer.

### Fixed
- **A broken model no longer wins the ranking forever** — when a gateway answered with no content at all, the crash it caused wasn't recognised as that model's fault, so auto-selection kept re-picking it: one real scan spent 28 attempts on a single model that failed 19 times. Empty and unreadable replies are now classified and de-ranked like any other failure, and a model that times out is dropped immediately instead of being retried three times (measured: ~40 minutes wasted in one scan).
- **Scan scoring refuses models too small or too specialised for the job** — under a rate-limit storm every decent model was penalised and a 12-billion-parameter *vision* model ended up writing two of the top scores. Models below the quality floor, plus reasoning/vision/safety-classifier builds, are now excluded outright; if none survives, the offer gets an honest local estimate that says so.
- **Batched scoring can't copy one verdict across several jobs** — three different postings came back with byte-identical match scores (two of them 10/10). Duplicated verdicts inside a batch are detected and those jobs are re-scored one at a time.
- **Jobs you can't apply to are capped instead of recommended** — postings based outside the EU (no visa, no relocation) and postings demanding a minimum degree grade above yours were scoring up to 8 with "Apply now". Both are now hard-capped and the reason is listed under what's missing. Better still, they're detected *before* the AI call, so they no longer cost quota.
- **Work mode reflects the posting, not your search filter** — every job of a remote-flagged scan was stored as "Full Remote", including plainly on-site ones. It's now read from the posting, and left as "not specified" when nothing says.
- **The analysis always has the same shape** — the model returned three different field sets within a single scan, so the detail panel sometimes rendered an empty radar or no skills. Missing fields are filled in with neutral values.
- **Indeed searches the right country** — with several locations in one scan (e.g. Germany while the scan country was Italy) Indeed queried the wrong domain and returned nothing. The country now follows each location, and Indeed is skipped for locations no single domain can serve, with LinkedIn still running.

### Added
- **Salary expectations** — set a minimum and a target salary in your search goals: scoring weighs them, and an offer declaring less is flagged (never silently downranked). "Suggest salary with AI" proposes both figures from your CV and the offers you're already looking at, in one cached call — you review and save them yourself.
- **Task work is labelled** — platform/gig postings (pay per task, no guaranteed hours) are marked as such in the job detail, so they're not mistaken for employment.

### Changed
- The match radar hides the salary axis when nothing is known about pay, instead of drawing a confident middle score: on real data that axis was invented for 46 jobs out of 78.
- Role suggestions read from a CV now recognise AI/LLM experience (evaluation, prompting, annotation) instead of defaulting to generic developer titles.

## [1.7.5] — 2026-07-16

Smarter matching: degree requirements finally count, and Indeed coverage stops collapsing.

### Fixed
- **A job asking for a Master's/PhD can no longer score 9 for a Bachelor's CV** — the scorer now explicitly compares the posting's hard requirements (degree, minimum grade, years of experience, language level) against the CV and must make any gap visible: lower score, lower seniority match, and the missing requirement listed under "mancano". The analysis also reports the required degree (`titolo_studio_richiesto`), and the offline heuristic penalizes Master's/PhD postings too.
- **Old inflated scores heal themselves** — analyses saved before this change don't know about degree requirements, so a job that re-appears in a scan is re-scored once with the new rules instead of keeping its stale score forever. (First scan after updating may re-score more jobs than usual.)
- **Indeed no longer returns a handful of results** — jobspy applies only ONE filter server-side on Indeed: with the freshness window set, remote/job-type were silently ignored AND the date filter collapsed results in smaller markets (measured from Italy: 4 rows vs 20 for the same query). Indeed is now scraped without the server-side date filter — remote and job-type work again — and freshness is enforced locally on each posting's date, keeping postings whose date is unknown. LinkedIn behaviour is unchanged, and one site failing no longer discards the other's results.

## [1.7.4] — 2026-07-16

Stability pass: a full audit of the scan pipeline, providers and UI. Scans no longer lose scored jobs to thread races, near-empty postings can't fool the scorer, and the kanban finally archives.

### Fixed
- **Scans no longer lose scored jobs under load** — two thread races (usage logging writing outside the database lock, and the model penalty map being read and rewritten concurrently) could corrupt a write or throw away a whole batch of scored jobs mid-scan. Both paths are now properly serialized.
- **A job scored on a near-empty description is flagged, not trusted** — LinkedIn sometimes serves an 82-character marketing blurb instead of the real posting; the AI would hallucinate requirements from it. Anything under ~300 characters now takes the honest capped path (score ≤ 6, "descrizione troppo breve") and the relevance gate judges such jobs by title only.
- **An empty AI reply can no longer freeze a job at score 0 forever** — a model answering 200-with-nothing used to be persisted as a valid analysis, so the job was never re-scored. Empty replies now fail over to the next model, and a scoreless reply falls back to the heuristic.
- **Models that cut off their answers are caught on Anthropic too** — truncation detection (already live for OpenAI-compatible providers) is now wired into the Anthropic provider.
- **Rate-limit errors no longer trigger a second wasted call** — a 429/401 during JSON scoring used to fire a hidden retry at the same struggling host before failing over; transport errors now go straight to failover, and JSON wrapped in markdown fences is salvaged locally with zero extra calls.
- **A just-failed model is no longer re-proposed when the catalog is down** — the no-catalog fallback now respects model penalties (with an anti-brick escape so a single-provider setup keeps working).
- **Deleting a job cleans up after itself** — timeline entries, recruiter info and chat pins used to linger invisibly forever; deletes now remove them, and a one-off migration sweeps the orphans accumulated in existing databases.
- **Searching for `%` or `_` matches literally** instead of acting as a hidden wildcard.
- A corrupt `local_secrets.json` now logs a clear warning instead of silently unconfiguring every provider.

### Added
- **Archive from the kanban board** — the per-card status dropdown now includes "Archived" (it was also missing from the API, which rejected the action).
- Dedicated test coverage for all 23 job endpoints; dependencies pinned to the exact tested versions.

## [1.7.3] — 2026-07-14

Sharper matching: the AI reads the requirements even on long postings, and obviously off-topic jobs are dropped before they're scored.

### Fixed
- **Requirements are read even on long job descriptions** — the scorer used to only see the first ~1800 characters, so on a long posting the "Requirements" block (which comes after the intro and responsibilities) was cut off — a role asking for a Master/PhD or 5 years could still score a 9 for a junior. The description is now packed to keep the requirements section in view, so experience and qualifications actually count.
- **Off-topic jobs are dropped before scoring** — a search for niche roles ("AI Quality Analyst", "Linguistic QA Analyst") made LinkedIn return unrelated Quality Control jobs (manufacturing, food, even a spa kitchen helper). Jobs whose text shares nothing with your skills/domain are now skipped before the AI scores them, so the archive stays on-topic and less AI quota is wasted. It only drops jobs with zero overlap, and logs each one.

### Changed
- **Removing a role from the search is now permanent** — deleting a keyword chip in Job Search also removes it from your saved roles, so it no longer re-appears on the next visit.
- Role suggestions (from the CV and the coach) now prefer specific, board-searchable titles and avoid bare generic ones that match unrelated jobs.

## [1.7.2] — 2026-07-14

Correctness: the AI now actually reads LinkedIn job descriptions before scoring.

### Fixed
- **LinkedIn jobs are scored on their real description, not just the title** — LinkedIn's search only returns job cards (title/company), so the app was scoring LinkedIn jobs blind: a role requiring 3-5 years of experience could get a 9 for a junior profile because the AI never saw the requirements. The scan now fetches each LinkedIn job's full description (Indeed already included it), so experience, seniority and required skills are actually weighed. This adds ~1.5s per LinkedIn job to a scan — a fair price for scores you can trust.
- **No more `nan`/`None` leaking into scoring** — a missing field from the scraper used to become the literal text `"nan"`/`"None"` in the AI prompt; those are now cleaned to empty.

### Changed
- **A job whose description can't be fetched is flagged, not faked** — on the rare occasion LinkedIn blocks a single job's page (even after a retry), that job is marked "description unavailable — open the posting to judge" with a capped estimate from the title, so an unread job can never surface as a top "Apply now".

## [1.7.1] — 2026-07-14

Reliability: scans no longer stall on models that cut off their answers.

### Fixed
- **Scans skip models that truncate their answers** — some free models (large "reasoning" models especially) spend their token budget on hidden thinking and return a JSON reply that's cut off mid-way. That used to make a scan retry the same model over and over — or silently fill the gaps one job at a time — and crawl (a full scan could take ~20 minutes). The app now detects a cut-off reply (`finish_reason=length`), drops that model for the rest of the scan, and routes scoring to a leaner model that answers cleanly, so a scan finishes in seconds again. Works across every provider that speaks the OpenAI API (OpenRouter, Cerebras, Google, OpenAI).
- **"Test models" best pick now agrees with scoring** — the model highlighted in the free health report respects the same quality floor the scan scorer uses, so it never recommends a model too small (or too truncation-prone) for real work.

### Changed
- The scan-scoring quality floor is now ~26B (was 40B), so reliable mid-size models (e.g. gemma-class) that emit clean JSON stay eligible instead of being passed over for larger models that truncate.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-14

A quality pass: much faster scans, a smarter model picker, and privacy/UX fixes.

### Added
- **AI CV tools** — a dedicated panel on the Profile tab: **Review my CV** (prioritized, role-targeted advice, now rendered as clean formatted text and cached) and **Improve my CV** (an AI rewrite tuned to your target role, with your real contacts, that you can copy or save as a new active CV). Both run on a capable model.
- **Edit your CV in-app** — change your display name and the CV text directly (the text feeds AI job scoring), no re-upload needed.
- **Faster scans** — jobs are now scored in parallel instead of one at a time, so a scan finishes in seconds rather than minutes.
- **Batched scoring (fewer rate-limit failures)** — the scan now scores a few jobs per AI request instead of one each, so a scan makes far fewer calls: on a free API tier that means fewer "too many requests" errors (which otherwise drop a job to a rough keyword-only estimate) and a faster run. A batch that comes back malformed automatically falls back to per-job scoring, so quality never degrades. Tunable via `scan_batch_size` (default 3; set 1 for the old one-per-call behaviour).
- **Stop a scan for real** — the cancel button (and closing the tab) now stops the scan on the server too, so it stops using your AI quota immediately.
- **Smarter model selection** — the app learns which of your provider's models actually work: it automatically avoids models that are rate-limited, return nothing, or aren't available on your plan, and picks a fast *but capable* model for job scoring (a quality floor stops it choosing a model too small to match jobs well). On OpenRouter it also reads each model's **live health** (uptime/latency, published by OpenRouter and free to fetch — no extra AI requests) and steers scoring away from models that are down right now, so scans hit fewer errors. The **"Test models"** button in Settings now shows that free health report (uptime · latency · throughput) without spending any of your AI quota; a separate **"Confirm top models"** button optionally runs a tiny check on just the best few to verify they return valid answers.

### Fixed
- **Privacy Mode now also covers the coach chat** — your CV's email, phone and address are stripped before the chat is sent to the AI provider (the coach still knows your name).
- **Tailored résumé keeps your real contacts** — the generated résumé shows your real email/phone again instead of `[EMAIL]`/`[PHONE]` placeholders (the AI still never sees them).
- **Interview prep reads cleanly** — it's now formatted text instead of a raw data blob.
- **Profile** — the education line and the "1 year" label render correctly.
- **Job Search "remote only" filter** now refreshes the list on its own.
- A failed scan no longer wipes the "new" badges from the previous run, and two scans can no longer run at once.

### Changed
- CSV export downloads in your browser instead of writing a file into the app folder.
- Accessibility: dialogs close with Escape and trap focus; the job link has a proper label; the chat input is disabled while a reply is loading.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-09

A dedicated Jobs tab, a job-detail panel you can open from anywhere, application reminders, saved searches, kanban drag-and-drop, and more ways to let the AI help.

### Added
- **Jobs tab + shared detail panel** — the job archive (table + kanban) now lives in its own **Jobs** tab, and the job-detail panel is a shared side drawer you can open from the dashboard, the archive, or the coach chat (previously it only worked on the dashboard). The dashboard is now a lean overview: highlights, recommendations, reminders, analytics.
- **Application reminders & deadlines** — set a follow-up date + note on any job, and get an automatic nudge for applications that have gone quiet. A "Reminders & deadlines" card on the dashboard and a badge on the nav show what needs attention.
- **Saved searches** — save the current Job Search filters as a named preset and re-run them with one click.
- **Recruiter outreach message** — a new button on a job drafts a short, personalized message to the posting's recruiter (using the recruiter's name/role when available), in your UI language, with Privacy Mode applied.
- **Skill-gap → learning suggestions** — a "How to close them" button turns your skill gaps into concrete learning ideas (course / book / project) with a one-line why, in your language.
- **Kanban drag-and-drop** — drag a job card between Open / Applied / Interviewing / Rejected columns to change its status (with a per-card status dropdown as an accessible fallback).
- **Configurable cross-source dedup** — the same role found on LinkedIn and Indeed is now grouped into one card with an "also on" badge. A new Settings option controls the grouping (exact / by city / title+company); "by city" now matches different location spellings.
- **CV management, surfaced** — the CV history (set active / delete) moved to the top of the Profile tab, and a delete button sits next to the profile switcher on the dashboard.
- **Richer LinkedIn context** — saving your LinkedIn profile now best-effort fetches the page text, with a paste-the-text fallback when the fetch is blocked; the text feeds the AI's scoring and letters.
- **Import a job from a link** is now a visible button on the Job Search tab (previously only reachable inside the Add-a-job dialog).

### Fixed
- **Self-update no longer opens a duplicate browser tab** — after an update the existing tab reloads in place instead of a second tab opening (takes effect from the next update onward).
- Kanban now reaches all four columns on any window width (single column on narrow windows) and no longer overflows horizontally.

### Changed
- **Internal: `web/app.js` split into focused modules** (`job_list`, `job_detail`, `scan`) — the monolith dropped from ~2340 to ~1590 lines with no behavior change. Pure refactor for maintainability.

## [1.5.6] — 2026-07-08

Privacy for your CV, a CV advisor, importing jobs from a link, and a self-update that survives being reopened.

### Added
- **Privacy Mode** (on by default) — your name, email, phone and address are stripped from the CV before it's sent to any AI provider. Scoring and profile summaries never see them; cover letters and tailored resumes get your real name restored in the final text. Toggle it in Profile → CV tools & privacy.
- **CV improvement advice** — a "Review my CV" button in Profile asks the AI for prioritized, actionable suggestions. It uses your **search goals** (target sector, career goal, seniority, work mode) — a short form now in Profile — which also sharpen job scoring.
- **Import a job from a link** — the "Add a job" dialog now takes a posting URL (with a paste-the-text fallback when a site like LinkedIn blocks the fetch); the AI extracts title/company/description and scores it against your profile.
- **Unified model picker** — the coach's provider/model dropdowns are replaced by a single "Provider · Model" popover: providers on the left, models on the right with ⭐ recommended and Free/Paid groups.

### Fixed
- **Model rotation on rate limits** — when a model returns 429 the app now tries another model of the *same* provider within the request (not only another provider), and de-ranks the rate-limited one for a few minutes — so a single OpenRouter :free model going busy no longer drops chat/scoring to the degraded fallback.
- **CV tools no longer error out on a chatty model** — if the model replies in prose instead of the expected JSON, the CV review / cover letter / interview prep / resume tailoring now fall back to plain text instead of failing with a 502.
- **Self-update no longer breaks if you reopen the app mid-update** — a single-instance guard plus an update-in-progress check stop a second launch from locking `JobFinder.exe` while the updater is replacing it (the "stuck at 95%" failure). The "Update now" button also unsticks itself if a previous update was interrupted.
- **Untranslated UI strings after an update** — locale files are now cache-busted with the app version, so new translations show up immediately instead of the raw key (e.g. `chat.degradedNote`).
- **Clearer chat message when the AI is rate-limited** — the fallback now says the AI is unavailable and to add your own API key, instead of a vague "message saved".
- Fixed the wrapped "Every / Min score" labels in the auto-scan settings.

### Changed
- **Settings/Profile reorganization** — CV tools (interview prep, resume tailoring, skill-gap, CV review) and Privacy Mode now live in your Profile, next to the CV; Settings keeps API keys, scheduled scans and notifications.

## [1.5.5] — 2026-07-06

Provider-resilience hardening, native tray notifications, and a refreshed README.

### Added
- **Native desktop notifications** — the opt-in "new high-scoring jobs" alert now fires from the system-tray icon, so it works even with no browser tab open. The tray menu (Open / Quit) is also shown in your UI language.
- **Configurable GLM endpoint** — set `GLM_BASE_URL` to point the Zhipu/GLM provider at the China console (`open.bigmodel.cn`) instead of the international default.

### Fixed
- **A transient 401 no longer disables a provider for the whole session** — a key flagged invalid is automatically re-probed after a cooldown (default 10 min); if it's still bad it's simply re-flagged.
- **Auto model selection avoids a rate-limited model** — a model that keeps returning 429 is de-ranked for a few minutes so selection rotates to another, instead of hammering the same one.

### Changed
- README, demo screenshots, and the hero GIF refreshed to cover v1.5.1–v1.5.4 (quit + system tray, dark mode, dashboard job display, AI usage panel, manual add, job timeline + notes, desktop notifications).

## [1.5.4] — 2026-07-06

Four features that surface data the app already had, plus a quieter test build.

### Added
- **AI usage panel** on the dashboard — tokens and calls per provider, over Today / 7 days / 30 days / all time. The app already recorded this on every LLM call; now you can see it.
- **Add a job manually** — a "+ Add job" button in Job Search opens a short form for referrals or roles found off LinkedIn/Indeed; the job is AI-scored against your CV just like a scanned one.
- **Per-job history + notes** — the job detail panel now shows a timeline of status changes and lets you attach free-text notes.
- **Desktop notifications** (opt-in, in Settings) when the scheduled auto-scan finds new jobs above your score threshold — so you don't have to be watching the app.

### Fixed
- The bundled app no longer opens a browser tab when it is launched only for an automated health check (`JOBFINDER_NO_BROWSER`).

## [1.5.3] — 2026-07-06

Polish & fix pass: working scan filters, dark-mode fixes, dead-code cleanup, accessibility.

### Fixed
- **Scan filters now actually filter** — "On-site" work mode and multiple contract types were silently ignored (same class as the Remote-filter bug); results are filtered after scraping, keeping listings whose data the source didn't report. (Experience "Mid" stays a neutral no-narrow.)
- **The Coach's "fill the scan form" action** now takes you to Job Search — where the form actually is — instead of Settings, and the message says so.
- **Chat opened the wrong conversation on startup** — it now loads the last-active session, matching the dropdown, so replies go to the session you see.
- **Chat suggestion chips** disappear once you send a message and reappear on a fresh or emptied chat.
- **CSV export** shows an error toast instead of failing silently (e.g. when there are no jobs to export).
- **Switching the active profile** now refreshes recommendations, analytics, and skill-gap instead of leaving stale data.
- **Dark mode** — the Info tab, the post-scan summary, and the advanced-filters panel were hardcoded light and looked broken in dark theme; they now follow the theme. Brand purples, match-score colours, status pills, and destructive red were consolidated onto theme tokens so everything adapts in both light and dark.

### Changed
- **Accessibility** — visible keyboard-focus rings on all controls, `aria-label`s on icon-only buttons and the dashboard charts, press feedback, and a global uncaught-error handler.
- **Dead code removed** — unused CSS blocks and variables, an orphaned "Save draft" button, and no-op JavaScript were deleted.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-07-06

Adds a way to close the windowless app, and fixes how jobs are shown on the dashboard.

### Added
- **Quit the app** — a Quit button in the header (with a confirm) and a system-tray icon (Open / Quit). The windowless build had no terminal to close; now there's an explicit exit that stops the server cleanly.
- **Status column** in the jobs table, with a coloured pill per state (open / applied / interviewing / rejected).

### Fixed
- **Unscored jobs no longer read as "0/10"** — a job that hasn't been AI-scored yet shows "—" (not scored) instead of the worst possible score, everywhere jobs are listed.
- **Match scores are now colour-coded** (green / amber / red) in the table, kanban, recommendations, and detail panel — strong matches stand out at a glance.
- **The "Remote" filter now works** — it filtered nothing before; it now returns only jobs whose work mode is remote.
- **The jobs table has empty / loading / error states** instead of a silently blank grid.
- **The detail panel and dashboard charts are fully translated** — status labels, "location N/A", and chart labels no longer leak raw keys or mix Italian and English.
- Job links are HTML-escaped, dates are locale-formatted, and dead CSS was removed.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-07-06

Self-update reliability, a windowless build, per-request provider failover, and audit fixes.

### Fixed
- **Self-update no longer hangs at "Restart 95%"** — the bundle was built as a console app but relaunched by the updater with no console, so its first startup write hit a dead output handle and the new process died before it could serve, leaving the modal stuck forever. The app is now windowed and hardens its output streams on startup, so the relaunch always comes up. (Updating from 1.5.0 is unaffected: the new build also survives the already-installed old updater's relaunch.)
- **The update modal had no way out on failure** — if the new version never answered it sat at 95% for 10 minutes, then printed an English "refresh the page" hint that couldn't help. It now times out sooner into an explicit error state with an "open logs" action and a translated "reopen Job Finder manually" message, and reloads correctly even on fast machines that finish the swap between health checks.
- **The "reduced answer" chat indicator never rendered** — the `degraded` flag was dropped by the response model, so a canned fallback looked identical to a real LLM reply. It now reaches the UI.
- **A CV upload could freeze the whole app for minutes** — parsing/OCR and the LLM summary ran on the event loop; they now run off it, and the summary no longer retries five times around an already-retrying call (worst case dropped from ~15 min to one bounded attempt).
- **Broken secondary-text colour** — a dozen styles referenced an undefined CSS variable, rendering "muted" text at full strength; pointed at the real token.

### Added
- **No terminal window** — the app runs windowed; no console flashes on launch or auto-update.
- **Per-request provider failover** — when the active provider is rate-limited or down, chat and analysis now try the other configured providers before falling back to the offline reply; a key that returns 401 mid-session is now flagged, not just at startup.

### Changed
- **Auto model selection de-emphasises the free tier** — the `:free` bonus is now a tie-breaker instead of a large boost, so a rate-limited free model is less likely to be auto-picked over a better one.
- **Update lock TTL raised to 180s** so a slow download can't let a second updater start mid-update.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-03

Major release: hardened LLM provider selection, four new providers, automatic cache-busting, a rewritten CV parser, smarter chat, and job-search + settings UX upgrades.

### Added
- **Four new LLM providers** — DeepSeek, xAI (Grok), Zhipu GLM, Mistral — via a reusable `OpenAICompatibleProvider` base (a future OpenAI-compatible provider is now a tiny subclass). Ten providers total.
- **Remove-key button** per provider in Settings, so a provider you never want no longer lingers.
- **Min-salary filter** in the scan form. (Extra job sources — Glassdoor, Google, ZipRecruiter — were prototyped but pulled from the UI before release: the underlying scrapers return no results from Italy. The API still accepts them via the `sites` param.)
- **"Reduced answer" indicator** — chat now marks replies served from the offline fallback (e.g. during rate-limits) instead of passing them off as full LLM answers.

### Fixed
- **A dead provider key no longer bricks the LLM** — startup used to commit to the first provider even when its key returned 401 (a stale `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable was a common trigger); it now skips invalid providers and selects the next working one.
- **A junior CV was parsed as "Senior · 14 anni / 2016"** — experience no longer sums education/diploma date ranges, the graduation year is read from the degree line (and ignores regulation numbers like `2016/679`), and a recent graduate reads as "Junior".
- **`GET /api/scan/stream` was unguarded** — it now enforces provider-configured + rate-limit like `POST /api/scan`.
- **Multiple selected job types were silently dropped to the first** — selecting several now returns all of them.
- **Chat replied in the wrong language and forgot context** — it now replies in the language of your message and receives the recent conversation turns (not just a late summary); preference extraction no longer mis-fires on substrings ("qatar", "know").
- **Model recommendation was near-random for the new providers** — the scorer now knows the DeepSeek/xAI/GLM/Mistral (and Kimi/Command-R) model families.

### Changed
- **Cache-busting is automatic** — every app-owned asset (HTML, CSS, `chat.css`, `app.js`, and every ES module) is versioned from `__version__` at serve time, so a release no longer needs a manual `?v=` bump.
- **Settings model picker** — searchable model list on every provider, an explained ⭐ recommended marker, an "Auto (→ model)" hint showing what Auto resolves to, and a clearer key-invalid vs key-missing state.
- **Quieter logs** — OpenAI-compatible clients no longer double-retry (the SDK retry is disabled so only our own retry runs) and the `openai` logger is set to WARNING.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-12

Live-review bug-fix pass: restored the chat-session dropdown, killed an i18n boot race, stopped leaking provider errors into job summaries, fixed orphaned chat turns, and made the UI usable on phones.

### Fixed
- **Chat-session dropdown was empty again** (and the pinned-jobs strip silently failed) — `renderChatSessionDropdown` / `refreshPinnedStrip` called an undefined `escapeHtmlSafe`, throwing a `ReferenceError` that their `.catch()` swallowed. They now use the imported `escapeHtml`.
- **i18n boot race** — dynamically-injected markup (provider cards, chat empty-state) and the session dropdown were rendered before `initI18n()` finished, leaving English fallback text under an Italian locale and emitting `[i18n] missing translation` warnings. `applyTranslations(root)` is now exported and re-applied after dynamic injection; chat/session init runs after i18n is ready.
- **Provider errors leaked into job summaries** — the heuristic-fallback `riassunto` embedded the raw exception (e.g. `Error code: 401 - Wrong API Key`). The raw reason is now logged only; the user-facing text is generic ("IA non disponibile").
- **Orphaned chat turns** — if a turn failed after the user message was persisted, no assistant reply was saved, leaving dangling user messages. `handle_chat_message` now always persists a coherent assistant reply (or a generic error message) so history stays consistent.
- **Job detail header showed the location twice** (e.g. `Torino, PIE, IT | Score 7/10 | Torino`) — `modalita` was hardcoded to a city name for non-remote scans; it's now `In sede`, and the header de-duplicates defensively for legacy rows.

### Added
- **Responsive / mobile layout** — below 960px the top nav collapses into a hamburger menu and the Career Coach becomes an off-canvas drawer (floating button); wide tables scroll inside their wrapper and multi-column dashboards collapse to a single column. Desktop layout is unchanged.

### Changed
- **Static assets are cache-busted** (`?v=1.4.2` on `app.js` / `styles.css`) so the dashboard picks up new front-end code after a self-update without a manual hard refresh. Bump the query string on each release.

### Maintenance
- One-off `scripts/clean_dirty_data.py` (with automatic DB backup) to purge orphaned chat messages, empty sessions, and job summaries that captured a provider error before this release.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-12

Polish + CI fix follow-up to v1.4.0.

### Fixed
- **Dark mode** — several elements hardcoded light/yellow backgrounds (the no-API-key banner, onboarding card, post-scan score chips, skills-match chips, Info-tab cost tags, Job Search pill toggles) that looked harsh on the dark surface. They're now theme-aware; light theme is unchanged.
- **CI was red** — a floating `mypy` upgrade started flagging an optional-import guard (`requests = None`) the project's older local mypy didn't. Pinned the lint/test tools (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pytest-cov`) and added `types-requests` so CI and local agree, and annotated the guard.
- **Hung LLM call could exhaust the timeout thread pool** — the per-attempt timeout now uses a dedicated daemon thread per call instead of a fixed 4-worker pool, so a stuck provider can't block other calls.
- **Auto-scan run could die silently** — `run_once` now catches and logs any error and returns a status dict, so the manual "Run now" background thread never crashes unnoticed.

### Changed
- **Chat input** — now a textarea: **Enter sends**, **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline; it auto-grows as you type. The suggested-prompt chips are no longer hidden behind the input.
- **Scan dialog** — the close button now reads just "Close" (red, clearly the stop action); the minimize-to-corner button is highlighted so it's easy to find.
- **Windows bundle** — ships a `LEGGIMI.txt` / quick-start guide next to `JobFinder.exe`.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-11

New AI features (interview prep, resume tailoring, skill-gap, scheduled auto-scan), all toggleable, plus reliability fixes and a backend refactor.

### Added
- **Interview-prep generator** — from a job's detail panel, generate the most likely technical + behavioural interview questions for that listing, each with a CV-tailored answer hint. `POST /api/jobs/{id}/interview-prep`. Off-switch in Settings → Features.
- **Resume tailoring** — generate a version of your CV reordered and keyworded for a specific listing (truthful, ATS-friendly), with copy-to-clipboard. `POST /api/jobs/{id}/tailored-resume`. Toggleable.
- **Skill-gap analysis** — a Dashboard panel aggregating the skills your scored jobs most often flag as missing (excluding ones already on your CV), so you know what to learn. `GET /api/skill-gap`. Pure aggregation over stored analysis — no extra LLM calls. Toggleable.
- **Scheduled auto-scan** — an in-process scheduler re-runs your last search every N hours while the app is open and surfaces new jobs scoring ≥ a threshold via a Dashboard highlights banner. Configurable interval + min score, manual "Run now". `GET /api/scheduler/status`, `POST /api/scheduler/config|run-now|dismiss`. Off by default.
- **Generation infrastructure** — `app/services/generation.py` centralises profile-aware LLM generation behind prompt templates in `app/prompts/generation/`; the cover-letter endpoint now reuses it.
- **Per-feature toggles** — optional features are enabled/disabled from a new Settings → Features card, persisted in `preferences`. New i18n keys across all 5 locales (450 keys each).

### Fixed
- **DB write race** — `Database`'s lock was declared but never acquired; writes now serialize through an `@_synchronized` reentrant lock so concurrent scans / multiple tabs can't corrupt or lose updates. Reads stay lock-free (WAL).
- **Hung LLM calls could stall the SSE scan stream** — each provider attempt now runs under a wall-clock timeout (`LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, default 60s; Windows-safe via a thread pool), counted as a retryable error.
- **Silent exception swallowing** — two `except: pass`/`continue` sites (analytics score parsing, Cerebras model-list decode) now log at debug, honoring the project's no-silent-except policy.

### Changed
- **Backend refactor** — the 983-line `app/main.py` monolith (49 routes) was split into per-domain routers under `app/routers/` (system, providers, profile, scan, jobs, chat, preferences, scheduler) with `AppContainer` extracted to `app/container.py`. API contract unchanged.
- **E2E smoke modernised** — the Playwright smoke suite, stale since the v1.3 UI redesign, was rewritten around structural assertions (shell loads, every nav tab activates, zero console errors, provider-cards contract).

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-06

UX polish + critical migration baseline fix.

### Fixed
- **Migration baseline skipped 005 on existing v1.2.x DBs** — `apply_migrations` used to seed the tracker at the highest known version when no `schema_version` table existed, which meant any user upgrading from v1.2.8 → v1.3.0 had migration 005 silently skipped, leaving them without the `chat_sessions` / `pinned_jobs` / `recruiters` tables and the `candidate_profiles.name` column. Result: empty chat-session dropdown, broken new/delete buttons, broken pin-to-chat flow. Fix: introduced `BASELINE_VERSION = 4` constant; baseline now seeds at the last v1.2.x version and pending migrations after it run normally. All v1.3.0 migrations are idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `INSERT OR IGNORE`, column-existence check) so re-running them on partially-applied DBs is safe.
- **Chat session dropdown empty** — `refreshChatSessions` swallowed fetch errors and left `ChatSessions.list = []`. Now always falls back to a synthetic `default` session so the dropdown is never empty, even if the backend is unreachable.
- **Post-scan summary modal didn't appear** — the show call was wrapped in a silent `try { ... } catch (_) {}` and ran *before* the scan overlay closed, so any error vanished and the modal could be covered. Now we close the scan overlay first, then show the modal, and log errors to the console so regressions surface.

### Changed
- **Chat sidebar hidden on the Info view** — the `right-rail` aside used to overlap the Info docs. `activateView('info')` now toggles `.hidden` on it. Other views keep the sidebar.
- **Chat suggestions capped at 2** — server-side default `suggest_chat_prompts(limit=2)`; frontend `loadChatPrompts` slices to 2 as a safety. Empty-state suggestions reduced from 4 to 2 keys.
- **Info view redesigned** — auto-fit grid of cards, icon per card, `<table>` for the AI providers section with cost tags (Free / Mixed / Paid). Less vertical scroll, easier to scan.
- **Job Search filters made compact** — Experience / Contract / Work-mode checkboxes converted to **pill-toggle groups** inside a collapsible `<details class="scan-advanced">` (closed by default). LinkedIn / Indeed / Remote stay as quick toggles above. Single-page form is now visually concise without losing options.

### Added
- New i18n keys: `info.providers.col.{name,cost,notes}`, `scan.filters.advanced` — translated into all 5 supported languages.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-06

Critical updater hotfix.

### Fixed
- **In-app updater crashed with `Failed to load Python DLL ... _internal/python311.dll`** when staging `Updater.exe` to `%TEMP%`. The v1.2.8 fix copied only `Updater.exe` to a per-PID temp dir but not the adjacent `_internal/` folder. PyInstaller's onedir bootloader loads `python311.dll` from `<exe parent>/_internal` *before* Python starts, so the staged binary crashed at launch and the install dir was left untouched (or partially overwritten by a parallel sync attempt that then hit a `PermissionError` on the locked `Updater.exe`). Fix: also `shutil.copytree` the entire `_internal/` directory next to the staged `Updater.exe`. `app/main.py:start_bundle_update`. **Users on v1.3.0 or earlier must download the v1.3.1 bundle ZIP from GitHub Releases manually** — the in-app updater on those versions still has the bug and cannot self-recover.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-06

Major UX & AI release: multi-chat, internship/role filters, recruiter-targeted cover letters, scan progress with ETA, post-scan summary, info tab, smarter chat output.

### Added
- **Multi-chat sessions** — switch between separate conversations with the AI Coach via dropdown next to the chat panel; create new chats and delete old ones. Auto-titles from the first user message. New tables `chat_sessions` and migration `005_v130_multichat_pin_recruiter_name.py`. Endpoints: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/chat/sessions`.
- **Pin jobs to a chat** — open a job's detail panel and click "Pin to chat" to feed the full description (not just title+score) to the AI Coach. Pinned jobs appear as removable pills above the chat input. Endpoints: `POST/DELETE /api/chat/sessions/{id}/pin`. `chat/context.py::jobs_context` now prioritizes pinned jobs in the system prompt so the model can answer comparative questions ("which is better for me?").
- **Recruiter-targeted cover letters** — best-effort scrape of the LinkedIn job posting page extracts the poster's name/title/headline (`app/services/recruiter_scrape.py`, table `recruiters`). When available, `/api/jobs/{id}/cover-letter` opens the message with a nominal greeting and references the recruiter's role. Silently falls back to a generic letter when not exposed.
- **LinkedIn search filters** — Job Search view now exposes Experience (internship → senior), Job type (full-time, part-time, contract, temporary, internship), and Work mode (on-site, hybrid, remote) as multi-checkbox filters. `ScanRequest` carries `experience_levels`, `job_types`, `work_types` and the scanner augments search terms / forwards `job_type` to jobspy.
- **Scan progress with %, ETA and step labels** — `run_scan` emits `{status: "progress", step, current, total, percent, elapsed_ms, eta_ms}` events; UI renders a real progress bar with "Analyzing 12/80 · ETA 2m 30s".
- **Post-scan summary modal** — on completion, a modal shows totals (found / new / analyzed / skipped / archived), elapsed time and the top 3 matches with score chips.
- **Info tab** — new top-level "Info" view with sections: what is Job Finder, getting started, AI providers, scanning & filters, chat coach (multi-chat & pinning), privacy, version. Translated to all 5 languages.
- **CV name extraction → avatar initials** — the LLM CV summary now extracts the candidate's full name (with a heuristic fallback). The "D" placeholder in the top-right is replaced with the user's actual initials and tooltip.
- **Enhanced job details** — analysis JSON now includes `requisiti`, `responsabilita`, `benefit`, `skills_match {hai, mancano}`, `livello_richiesto`. The detail panel renders bullet lists, a skills match grid (have vs missing) and a recruiter card when available.

### Changed
- **Chat output sanitization** — handler now strips orphan braces / partial JSON fragments from the assistant answer (`_sanitize_chat_answer`). System prompt explicitly forbids stray `{}`, JSON fragments and filler. Mostly fixes Groq emitting random `{` characters mid-prose.
- `candidate_profiles` schema gained a `name` column (nullable). Backfilled lazily on next CV upload.


Critical updater self-overwrite fix + chat model dropdown ordering.

### Fixed
- **Update from v1.2.6 → v1.2.7 failed with `PermissionError(13) … Updater.exe`** — the updater process tried to overwrite its own running binary. Windows holds an exclusive section-object lock on a running EXE, so `shutil.copy2` is guaranteed to fail no matter how many retries. Worse, `sync_install_dir` had already overwritten most files (including `JobFinder.exe`) before reaching `Updater.exe`, leaving installs in a partially-updated state (new JobFinder + old Updater). Fix: `app/main.py` now copies `Updater.exe` to a per-PID `%TEMP%\jobfinder-updater-…` dir via `shutil.copy2` and spawns from there, so the install-dir copy is unlocked while sync runs. `scripts/updater.py` resolves the PyInstaller `_internal/` path from `--install-dir` instead of `sys.executable.parent` so imports keep working from temp. After restart, the updater spawns a detached `cmd /c timeout 5 & rmdir /s /q <tempdir>` to clean up. Defense-in-depth: `app/update_sync.py` also skips any destination that resolves to the current `sys.executable`.
- **Chat coach model dropdown was unsorted** — the `chatModelSelectorModel` in the chat panel iterated the raw API order while the Settings provider cards already sorted alphabetically (with OpenRouter Free/Paid grouping). Lifted the same logic into `_populateChatModelSelector` (`web/app.js`) so the chat dropdown matches Settings for every provider, including the recommended (⭐) model hoist.

### Added
- **`tests/unit/test_update_sync.py::test_sync_skips_current_executable`** — guards the defense-in-depth skip in `_is_current_executable`. 9 unit tests now (8 → 9).


CI hygiene.

### Fixed
- **`tests` workflow failed on `ruff format --check`** for the v1.2.6 push. The pre-commit local run only covered `ruff check` (the linter), not `ruff format --check` (the formatter). Two files (`app/main.py` and `tests/unit/test_open_logs_endpoint.py`) had stylistically minor reflow needed. Reformatted, no behavior change. The release artifact for v1.2.6 had already shipped (the `release` workflow on tag push is independent of the `tests` workflow on commit push), so this is purely a CI-green hygiene release with no user-visible effect.

## [1.2.6] — 2026-05-05

Visible app version, manual update check, log access for support.

### Added
- **Topbar version chip** — `<span class="version-chip">vX.Y.Z</span>` next to the "Job Finder" brand. Populated at boot from `/api/version`. Users always know which version they're running without opening Settings.
- **Settings → "System" card** — current version, last-check timestamp + result, "Check for updates" button, "Open logs folder" button. The check button calls `checkForUpdate({forceRefresh: true})` which forwards `?refresh=true` to `/api/version` and bypasses the 1 h `_cache` in `app/version.py` so the user gets a real GitHub round-trip on demand.
- **`POST /api/system/open-logs` endpoint** (`app/main.py`) — opens `data/logs/` in Windows Explorer via `os.startfile`. Returns 501 on non-Windows. Backed by 2 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_open_logs_endpoint.py` (157 → 159 total).
- **Update modal error state now shows "Open logs folder"** — when any step transitions to `error`, the verbose log block becomes clickable and a `→ Open logs folder for details` line is appended. One click opens `data/logs/` so the user can grab `updater.log` for support without hunting through `data\logs\` by hand. The handler is reset on each new `runUpdate()` call so the link is re-arm-able after a retry.

### Changed
- **`checkForUpdate()` is now a Promise that resolves to the version info** — was previously fire-and-forget. The Settings check button awaits it to render the result inline.

## [1.2.5] — 2026-05-05

Updater resilience against Windows Defender file scans.

### Fixed
- **`PermissionError(13)` persisted past the v1.2.1 retry budget** — three real-world update attempts each failed exactly 7 s after `replace_start` (= sum of the v1.2.1 backoff `1 s + 2 s + 4 s`). Likely cause: Windows Defender pre-scanning the freshly-extracted bundle (175 MB → ~10–20 s scan). Extended `_COPY_RETRY_DELAYS` in `app/update_sync.py` from `(1, 2, 4)` to `(1, 2, 4, 8, 16)` — five attempts spread over ~31 s, comfortably outlasting a typical AV scan window.
- **The retry-exhausted error now names the file that stayed locked** — replaced the bare `PermissionError` re-raise with one that carries `… (locked after 5 retries): D:\…\JobFinder.exe`. When updates fail again in the wild, the log identifies which file (almost always `JobFinder.exe` itself, or an OCR child) was the holdout. Previously the user only saw `Permission denied` with no file context.

### Added
- **3 s grace period after parent exit before sync starts** (`scripts/updater.py`) — `_wait_for_pid()` returns the moment the PID dies, but Windows can take a few more seconds to flush all inherited handles (uvicorn workers, Tesseract subprocess, AV pre-scan handles). The first file copy now waits 3 s after `parent_exited` instead of racing in immediately. Combined with the extended retry, the worst-case wait against AV is `3 s + 31 s = ~34 s` before the updater gives up — long enough for Defender to release locks on consumer hardware.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-05-05

Critical updater fix: restart now actually persists after Updater exits.

### Fixed
- **JobFinder.exe died seconds after restart, leaving the modal stuck at "Riavvio 95%"** — `scripts/updater.py` spawned the new JobFinder.exe with `subprocess.Popen([str(exe)])` and no `creationflags`. On Windows, `JobFinder.exe` is built with `console=True`, so the new process inherited Updater's console. When Updater returned and its cmd window closed, the JobFinder console closed with it and the just-spawned process died — port 8000 never came back up, the frontend health-poll loop spun until the 600 s timeout, and the user had no app. Fix: detach the restart with `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` (mirrors the flags `app.main.start_bundle_update` already uses to spawn `Updater.exe` from `JobFinder.exe`).

## [1.2.3] — 2026-05-05

Update banner readability + recover from stuck retry state.

### Fixed
- **Inline `<code>` segments inside the in-app release notes are now legible** — the v1.2.0 banner rendered backtick-fenced strings (`── Free ──`, `<option>`, locale keys, etc.) with a `<code>` element whose default background nearly matched the purple banner gradient, so users saw blank patches instead of text. Added explicit `background: rgba(0,0,0,0.35)`, white foreground, and a thin border so code reads on every banner state.
- **"Update now" button gets stuck after a closed modal or failed update** — when the user closed the update modal mid-run (X button) or the update errored, `localStorage["updateInProgress"]` and the backend lockfile both stayed set, so the next click was a no-op or returned HTTP 409. Modal close now clears both: it removes the localStorage flag, re-enables the button, and fires `DELETE /api/update/lock` to force-clear the backend lockfile.

### Changed
- **Backend lockfile TTL 300s → 60s** — 5 minutes was overkill for the legitimate "prevent double-spawn" case (parallel updaters fight within seconds, not minutes) and made it impossible to retry a failed update without sitting on your hands. 60s is enough to dampen accidental rapid double-clicks while keeping retry latency low.

### Added
- **`DELETE /api/update/lock` endpoint** — explicit force-clear of `data/update.lock`, called by the frontend on modal close. Safe at this point: either the updater succeeded (lockfile already gone) or it crashed (no live updater process to fight us for files).

## [1.2.2] — 2026-05-04

Settings model picker readability.

### Changed
- **OpenRouter shows all 371 models, sorted by tier then alphabetical** — replaced the v1.2.0 "Free only" toggle with a visible grouping. Models render as `── Free ──` then alphabetical free entries, then `── Paid ──` then alphabetical paid entries. Disabled `<option>` elements act as section headers. The search input still narrows by substring across both groups.
- **Other providers now sort alphabetically** — Cerebras, Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all render their model dropdowns in alpha order. The recommended ⭐ model still floats to the top regardless of name. Previously the order was whatever the provider API returned (insertion order, often arbitrary).

### Added
- Locale keys `settings.providers.freeGroup` / `paidGroup` for the OpenRouter section headers.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-04

Update flow reliability and UX polish. Driven by a real-world failure where v1.1.1 → v1.2.0 produced two parallel `Updater.exe` processes both racing on `JobFinder.exe` file locks (`PermissionError(13)`) and a 180 s timeout that wasn't enough for slow GitHub downloads of the 175 MB bundle.

### Added
- **Percent on the active step** — the v1.2.0 step indicator now shows the live percentage (5/10/15/50/55/70/75/90/95/100) returned by `/api/update/progress` next to the active label, e.g. *"Downloading new version · 35%"*. Step shows nothing once `done`.
- **Elapsed counter during health-poll wait** — replaced the dot-spam (`....................`) that grew while waiting for the new process to come back, with a single rewritten line `Elapsed: Xs`. No more wall of dots; users can see the wait advancing.
- **Update lockfile guard** — `POST /api/update/start` now writes `data/update.lock` (PID + target version, mtime as TTL marker) and refuses with HTTP 409 + `{code: "update_already_in_progress"}` if a second start arrives within 5 minutes of an existing one. Updater clears the lockfile on success or on any caught exception. Prevents the double-spawn race.
- **Frontend double-click guard** — the "Update now" button disables itself on click and writes `localStorage["updateInProgress"]` keyed by target version. A second click on the same version is a no-op until the page reloads or the flag is cleared. The flag is cleared on success, on timeout, and on any thrown error from `runUpdate`.
- **Retry-on-PermissionError in `sync_install_dir`** — `_copy_with_retry()` wraps `shutil.copy2` with a 3-step backoff (1 s / 2 s / 4 s) so a transient antivirus scan or a still-draining process handle no longer aborts the whole update. After the final retry, the error is propagated as before.

### Changed
- **Frontend update timeout 180 s → 600 s** — covers slow networks where a 175 MB bundle takes > 3 min to download. Elapsed counter makes the long wait observable.

### Fixed
- **Double-spawn updater race that produced `PermissionError` on `JobFinder.exe`** — root cause of the v1.1.1 → v1.2.0 update failures Diego observed (two updater PIDs spawned 35 s apart, both failed at the copy step).
- **Restart step now correctly transitions to "done" with 100%** before the page reload kicks in, instead of staying at the `active` pulsing state.

### Tooling
- 2 new tests in `tests/unit/test_update_sync.py` covering retry-on-PermissionError success and exhausted-retries propagation. Test count 155 → 157.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-04

UX release focused on visible release notes, a clear update flow, and a saner model picker.

### Added
- **In-app release notes** — the "Update available" banner now includes a `<details>` element rendering the release notes pulled from `/api/version` (`release_notes` field). Users see *what's new* without leaving the app. Markdown rendered via the existing `renderCoachMarkdown()` helper.
- **GitHub Release pages now show Added/Changed/Fixed bullets directly** — `release.yml` extracts the matching `[$version]` section from `CHANGELOG.md` via PowerShell regex and passes it as `body_path` to `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`. No more empty release pages with only a "Full Changelog" compare link.
- **Update progress modal with 4 step indicators** — when the user clicks "Update now", a new dialog (`#updateModal`) shows live progress through Download → Verify → Replace → Restart, driven by the new `GET /api/update/progress` endpoint that parses structured `EVENT {...}` JSON lines from `data/logs/updater.log`. Includes a hint text "The app will restart automatically and this page will reload" so users know what to expect.
- **OpenRouter search + free-only filter** — for providers exposing more than 30 models (only OpenRouter today, with 371 entries), the Settings card now shows a search input and a "Free only" checkbox above the model dropdown. The filter is applied client-side over the cached model list. Default state is "Free only" enabled, so first-time users immediately see the cheapest options.
- **Smarter Auto model picker** — `app/providers/model_selector.score_model_name()` now penalizes hard-avoid patterns (`embed`, `whisper`, `tts`, `dall-e`, `moderation`, `audio`) with `-1000`, soft-avoid (`preview`, `deprecated`, `experimental`, `alpha`) with `-50`, and rewards OpenRouter `:free` suffix with `+25`. New helper `pick_default_model()` filters out non-chat models entirely before ranking, so an embedding-only key never resolves to a chat default. 8 new unit tests in `tests/unit/test_model_selector.py`.

### Changed
- **`app/version.py`**: `release_notes` truncation raised from 500 to 2000 characters so a typical release section fits without being cut mid-sentence.
- **`scripts/updater.py`**: emits structured `EVENT {...}` JSON lines alongside the existing human-readable log, covering `started`, `parent_exited`, `download_start/done/skipped`, `verify_start/done`, `replace_start/done`, `restart_spawned`, `error`. Backwards-compatible: the human log lines remain unchanged.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: removed `generate_release_notes: true` (which only produced a "Full Changelog" auto-link) in favor of `body_path: release-notes.md` produced by the new extraction step.

### Fixed
- **Release notes invisible on GitHub Releases** — pages for v1.0.0/v1.1.0/v1.1.1 only showed a "Full Changelog: …" compare link with no content. From v1.2.0 onwards, the body is the actual `CHANGELOG.md` section.
- **Update flow appearing to hang** — previously the modal showed a single text blob ("Downloading update...") for the entire process, leaving users uncertain whether anything was happening. The new step indicator shows live state.

### Tooling
- 8 new tests covering the model picker (147 → 155 total).
- Ruff, mypy strict, format clean.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-04

Hotfix release focused on the bundled `Updater.exe` UX.

### Fixed
- **`Updater.exe` no longer flashes a console window** — `JobFinder.spec` now builds the updater with `console=False`. When the updater is invoked correctly by JobFinder (via `POST /api/update/start`), the user sees no transient cmd window.
- **Friendly dialog when `Updater.exe` is double-clicked** — `scripts/updater.py:main()` now detects the no-args case and shows a Windows MessageBox: *"Updater.exe is launched automatically by JobFinder. Open JobFinder.exe and click 'Update now' from the update banner."* Replaces the previous silent argparse crash that left users wondering why the cmd window vanished.

### Notes
- Update detection in v1.0.0 / v1.1.0 requires the GitHub repository to be **public** so the unauthenticated `_fetch_latest_release()` call can read `/releases/latest`. Private repos return 404 and `update_available` stays `false`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-04

Quality release focused on log-spam fix, true internationalization, soft onboarding, and a token-usage tracker.

### Added
- **Token usage tracker** — every `chat` / `complete_text` / `complete_json` call now records `prompt_tokens / completion_tokens / total_tokens` per `(provider, model, endpoint)` into the new `usage_log` table. New endpoint `GET /api/usage/stats?range=today|week|month|all` returns aggregates with per-provider and per-day breakdowns. No pricing/cost — just raw counts (deferred to v1.2.0). Migration `004_usage_log.py`. Unit tests in `tests/unit/test_usage_tracker.py`.
- **OCR multi-lingua** — `app/cv_ingest._ocr_image_bytes` and `_extract_text_pdf_via_ocr` now read the language list from `JOBFINDER_OCR_LANG` env var (set by `AppContainer` from `settings.ocr_languages`). Default `eng+ita+spa+fra+deu`. Bundle ships 5 traineddata files (`scripts/build_exe.py:_REQUIRED_LANGS` extended).
- **Browser locale auto-detect** — `web/modules/i18n.js` falls back to `navigator.languages` instead of always defaulting to English. First-run users with a Spanish/French/German/Italian browser see the UI in their language immediately. Stored preference still wins over auto-detect.
- **Soft onboarding gate** — `GET /api/setup/status` returns `{ready, provider_configured, cv_loaded, first_run}`. Frontend tracks `_setupReady`; `activateView()` redirects non-Settings tabs to Settings while no provider key is configured. Banner is now non-dismissable (close button removed). Tabs get a `tab-locked` CSS class with a 🔒 badge while gated.
- **Backend 412 guard** — `/api/chat` and `/api/scan` return HTTP 412 with `{code: "no_provider_configured"}` when no provider key is configured, protecting against direct API hits even if the UI gate is bypassed.
- **Provider invalid-key flag** — new `LLMProvider.key_invalid` attribute (set on HTTP 401, cleared on key reload via `ProviderManager.invalidate_caches()`). Stops the factory from re-attempting list_models on every health poll.
- **`extract_usage()` helper** in `app/providers/base.py` — best-effort token-usage extraction across heterogeneous SDK shapes (OpenAI/Groq/Cerebras/OpenRouter `usage`, Anthropic `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`, Google).
- **Expanded CV keyword dictionary** — added 9 Spanish, 9 French, 8 German keywords (`habilidades`, `competénce`, `kenntnisse`, etc.) so the validation gate is balanced across the 5 supported locales (was Italian-heavy in v1.0).
- **Spanish/French/German CV fixtures** in `tests/unit/test_cv_ingest.py` — `validate_cv_content_accepts_spanish_cv` + French + German tests confirm cross-locale acceptance.

### Changed
- **`metadata()` is now cached for 60 seconds** (`app/providers/factory.py:_metadata_cache`). Each `/api/health` poll used to call `provider.list_models()` 6× (one per provider with a key). Now a single cached payload is returned until the TTL expires or `invalidate_caches()` is called after a key save.
- **Bundle Tesseract from 3 to 6 traineddata files** (`scripts/build_exe.py:_REQUIRED_LANGS = ("eng", "ita", "spa", "fra", "deu", "osd")`). +10-12 MB zip size (~200 MB total).
- **No-API-key banner is now non-dismissable** — close button removed; banner clears itself once `loadHealth()` sees a configured provider.
- **Version aligned to 1.1.0** across `app/version.py` + `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixed
- **Cerebras 401 spam in logs** — when a stale Cerebras key was loaded from `data/local_secrets.json`, the app emitted "Cerebras SDK list_models failed (401)" + "Cerebras HTTP list_models failed (401)" on every health poll (≈1× per second). Root cause was triple: (1) `metadata()` lacked TTL caching, (2) `is_available()` returned True regardless of key validity, (3) `list_models()` retried both SDK and HTTP paths without remembering the failure. All three are now mitigated. Single 401 line is logged on first attempt, then the provider is marked `key_invalid` and silenced until the user re-saves keys.
- **Hardcoded `lang="ita+eng"`** in `cv_ingest._ocr_image_bytes` and `_extract_text_pdf_via_ocr` — the app no longer assumes Italian for OCR.

### Tooling & Quality
- Test count: **134 → 147 passing** (13 new tests for metadata cache, key_invalid flag, usage tracker, and 4 i18n CV fixtures).
- `ruff check app/ tests/` ✅, `ruff format` ✅, `mypy --strict` ✅ on 39 source files.

### Known limits
- Pricing/cost estimation deliberately excluded from v1.1.0. Pricing tables drift fast across providers; v1.2.0 will add an opt-in cost layer.
- Welcome modal (3-step locale + key + CV picker) not shipped — the soft gate alone covers the gap. May land in v1.1.1.
- Poppler still not bundled, so scanned PDFs (vs. image CVs) remain a lossy path.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-04

First stable public release. Adds OCR for image CVs and scanned PDFs, ships a refreshed Profile/Job Search UX, and consolidates the standalone Windows bundle.

### Added
- **OCR pipeline for CV ingest** (`app/cv_ingest.py`): images (`.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.webp/.avif/.tiff/.bmp/.svg`) are routed through Tesseract via `pytesseract`. Scanned PDFs fall back to `pdf2image` rasterization + OCR when `pypdf` returns < 50 chars. AVIF supported via `pillow-avif-plugin`. SVG with inline `<text>` tags parsed directly; full-graphic SVG returns empty (documented limit).
- **Tesseract bundling**: `scripts/build_exe.py:_bundle_tesseract()` copies the system Tesseract install (binary + `tessdata/` ita+eng) into `dist/JobFinder/vendor/tesseract/`. `cv_ingest._resolve_tesseract_cmd()` searches override env, bundle path, system PATH, and Windows default install dirs in that order.
- **CI Tesseract install**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` now `choco install tesseract` before `python scripts/build_exe.py` so the release zip ships with OCR ready.
- **Italian/EN/ES/FR/DE years phrase parser** (`_estimate_years_from_phrases`): captures explicit `Opero da N anni`, `Lavoro da N anni`, `Over N years of experience`, `experiencia de N años`, etc. Combined with the date-range parser via `max()` so explicit phrases never lose precedence to short overlap intervals.
- **Expanded CV keyword dictionary** for content validation: now includes `abilitazion`, `qualifica`, `carriera`, `studi`, `diploma`, `laurea` plus ES/FR/DE keywords, so OCR-noisy CVs (academic, vocational) pass the keyword gate.
- **Image-format hint in CV upload**: `web/index.html` `cvFile` input `accept=` lists every supported format; `cv-dropzone-hint` reads `PDF · DOCX · MD · TXT · IMG (JPG/PNG/AVIF)`.
- **Job deletion UI** (`53e286c`): per-row trash button in the jobs list with confirmation. Cascades through `Database.delete_job()`.
- **CV deletion / Multi-CV history controls** (`0413aaa`, `f3b1c7b`): delete CVs from the Profile tab history.
- **Language extraction from CV** (`45eed86`): `_extract_languages()` parses the dedicated Languages section (5-locale headers) into chips like `Italiano (Madrelingua)`, deduped case-insensitively. Surfaces in Profile chip-list and the LLM summary.
- **Role quick prompts in chat** (`d0097de`): CV-derived prompt suggestions appear as clickable pills above the chat input.
- **Auto-save chips on Profile** (`522e012`, `e2df912`): `preferred_roles` / `skills` / `languages` chip edits PATCH the active profile inline; chat suggestions stay in sync via the same store.
- **Job Search auto-detect experience** (`36b00d9`): flat layout, no wizard stepper. Profile-derived role chips populate `wizardRoleSuggestions` directly; clicking a chip adds it as a keyword tag.
- **6 new regression tests** (`tests/unit/test_cv_ingest.py`): word-boundary skill matching, no hardcoded fallback role, Italian years phrase, English `Over N years` phrase, max(date_intervals, phrase_years), data-analyst trigger expansion. Plus 3 OCR routing tests with mocked `pytesseract`. Suite **134/134**.

### Changed
- **Heuristic skill matching now requires word boundaries** (`_keyword_present()` with `(?<![a-z0-9])kw(?![a-z0-9])`). Previously `soc` matched inside `associato`, `git` inside `logistica`, `api` inside `capi` — non-tech CVs received fake tech skills. Same boundary rule applied to `role_map` triggers, so non-tech CVs no longer default to `Junior SOC Analyst`.
- **`data analy` trigger** split into 3 explicit triggers (`data analyst`, `data analysis`, `data analytics`) so the new word-boundary rule still maps Data-related CVs to the Data Analyst role.
- **Job Search wizard removed** in favor of a flat single-card layout (`web/index.html`). Removed selectors: `#wizardAnalyzeBtn`, `.wizard-steps`. Kept selectors: `#wizardProfileSummary`, `#wizardRoleSuggestions` (now populated automatically on view-enter).
- **README**: Demo section rewritten for the flat layout (6 beats, not 7); Features lists OCR + every new behavior; Tech stack and Project structure updated; Prerequisites mention Tesseract install per OS.
- **Version aligned** across `app/version.py` (was `0.1.0`) and `pyproject.toml` (was an out-of-sync `0.3.0`) → both now `1.0.0`.

### Fixed
- **`years_experience` ignored Italian phrases** (`d2c4db4` + this release): `Opero da 7 anni` now returns `7`, not `0`. Date-range scoping to the work section (commit `d2c4db4`) avoids false positives from graduation years; explicit-phrase parser added to fill the remaining gap.
- **Heuristic CV summary false skills** on non-tech CVs (see "word boundaries" above).
- **Hardcoded `Junior SOC Analyst` fallback** that surfaced on empty templates and non-tech CVs.
- **Generic 415 error message** for unsupported uploads now lists image formats so users know they can retry.
- **Playwright specs** (`tests/e2e/readme-demo-gif.spec.js`, `tests/e2e/readme-demo-screenshots.spec.js`): removed `#wizardAnalyzeBtn` clicks; the flat Job Search now scrolls into view directly.

### Tooling & Quality
- `requirements.txt`: + `pytesseract>=0.3.10`, `pdf2image>=1.17.0`, `Pillow>=10.0.0`, `pillow-avif-plugin>=1.4.0`.
- Test count: **122 → 134 passing** (~10% growth, all new tests cover regressions or new OCR routing).
- LLM retry callback (`d2c4db4`): up to 5 attempts, progressive 3/5/7/9 s waits, optional `on_retry(attempt, wait, exc)` for UI streaming.

### Known limits
- SVG CVs without inline `<text>` (pure vector artwork) fall through OCR with empty result. Workaround: convert to PNG/JPG before upload. Adding `cairosvg` rasterization is tracked for a later release because of the GTK runtime dependency on Windows.
- OCR quality on low-DPI scans can lose keyword matches; the expanded keyword dictionary mitigates this but doesn't eliminate it. Best results: 200+ DPI scans, well-lit photos.
- `pdf2image` requires Poppler. The standalone bundle does not yet ship Poppler, so scanned PDFs (vs. image CVs) will only OCR if the user has Poppler on PATH. Tracked for v1.0.x.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

First public release. Standalone Windows bundle, self-update, multi-LLM career-coach chat, scan, kanban, analytics, AI Provider cards, Profile tab.

### Added
- **AI Provider cards** (Settings): six per-provider cards (Cerebras, Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter) replace the flat keys form. Each card has its own state machine (empty / configured / fetching / error / active), per-provider Save & fetch, password-visibility toggle, primary radio, ⭐-recommended model dropdown, and a refresh button. Driven by `GET /api/providers/{name}/models` with a 5-minute TTL cache.
- **Chat per-model selector**: `#chatModelSelectorModel` next to the provider override, populated live from cached provider models. Provider override list filters to providers with a key (others shown as "(no key)" disabled). `/api/chat` accepts an optional `model` field that flows through `handle_chat_message` → `provider_manager.chat(model_name=…)`.
- **"Use as default?" toast**: shown once per session after the first chat override; persists `primary_provider` + `preferred_model` via `POST /api/providers/keys` on confirm.
- **Profile tab** (`#view-profile`, new module `web/modules/profile.js`): read-only view of the AI-summarized CV (preferred_roles, skills, languages, experience, original markdown), inline chip-list edit for the three list fields, CV history accordion with **Set active** per uploaded CV.
- **`PATCH /api/profile`**, `GET /api/profiles`, `POST /api/profiles/{id}/activate` + `Database.update_candidate_profile_summary`: updates the active profile's summary; `preferred_roles` changes also sync to the `preferred_roles` preference used by the role shortlist.
- **Unit test suite** (`tests/unit/`): coverage for chat context, handler parsing, fallback, CV ingest, scanner helpers, role shortlist, migrations, memory summarizer, provider retry, rate limiter, scraper canary.
- **Schema migrations** (`app/migrations/`): lightweight `schema_version`-tracked migrations, baseline detection for pre-existing DBs. 001 init schema, 002 `chat_messages.content_type`.
- **Role shortlist service** (`app/services/roles_shortlist.py`): dedicated module + `/api/roles/shortlist` GET/POST/DELETE. Dedup case-insensitive.
- **Career Coach UX**:
  - CV-derived + localized quick prompts (`/api/chat/prompts?lang=`).
  - Markdown rendering in coach bubbles (**bold** role names, *italic* hints, `code`, `-` bullet lists).
  - Role pills: clickable suggestions that add keywords to Step 2 without launching the search.
  - `suggested_roles` field in chat JSON envelope.
  - Conversation summarizer: condenses sessions >20 messages into a summary memory row.
- **No-API-key banner**: sticky warning when zero providers are configured.
- **Radar chart** (Chart.js) in job detail: skills / seniority / remote / salary / contract axes. Backend `match_axes` in `analyze_offer`.
- **Analytics**: `top_companies` widget with horizontal bar chart.
- **Export applications**: `GET /api/applications/export?format=csv|json` with tracking-relevant columns.
- **Onboarding wizard**: 3-step welcome overlay, localized in 5 languages, surfaces only when no CV loaded.
- **Fluid layout**: clamp-based typography + grid columns; design now scales with viewport without fixed breakpoints below 960px.
- **i18n**: `coach.expand/collapse/savedToShortlist`, `onboarding.*`, `banner.*`, `analytics.topCompanies`, `offcanvas.breakdown` + axis labels, `settings.providers.*` (19 keys), `chat.modelOverride/providerOverride/modelAuto/saveAsDefault/saveAsDefaultBody`, `common.yes/no`, `profile.*` (24 keys), and `topbar.profile` across en/it/es/fr/de — 259 keys per locale, 100% parity.
- **Unit tests** for the new endpoints: `tests/unit/test_providers_models_endpoint.py` (8 tests, including TTL cache hit + `force_refresh` bypass) and `tests/unit/test_profile_endpoint.py` (9 tests, including PATCH preference sync and CV-switch via `POST /api/profiles/{id}/activate`).

### Changed
- **Provider calls** retry on 429/5xx/timeout with exponential backoff + jitter (`LLM_MAX_RETRIES`, `LLM_RETRY_BASE_SECONDS` env).
- **Rate limiter** (`app/rate_limit.py`): in-process sliding window on `/api/chat` (20/min), `/api/scan` (5/min), `/api/upload-cv` (10/min). Toggle with `ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT`.
- **Scraper pacing**: random 0.8–2.4s sleep between terms; `canary_warning` SSE event when a common keyword returns zero results.
- **Frontend**: `app.js` entry is now an ES module; shared helpers extracted to `web/modules/helpers.js`, `shortlist.js`, `theme.js`. Chat styles moved to `web/styles/chat.css`.
- **Chat JSON envelope**: clarified formatting rules (markdown markers) and documented `suggested_roles` shape.
- **Prompts**: `advising.txt` / `onboarding.txt` include a "Role exploration" section guiding CV-aware pivots.
- **E2E**: `chat-role-guidance` and `live-cv-chat-search` now skip by default; opt in with `RUN_LIVE_LLM=1`. New `chat-live-smoke.spec.js` + `live-smoke.yml` manual workflow.

### Removed
- Chat expand/collapse toggle (layout is now fully fluid).

### Tooling & Quality
- **Toolchain**: `pyproject.toml` consolidates ruff, mypy strict, pytest, and coverage config. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` adds whitespace, ruff (lint + format), and mypy hooks; `pytest.ini` removed.
- **Mypy strict**: full pass on `app/`. New `Callable[[], _RetryT] -> _RetryT` generic on `_with_retry`, `cast()` wrapping for SDK and `json.loads` Any leakage, typed lifespan/SSE generators in `main.py`.
- **Coverage**: CI runs `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=xml`, `scripts/coverage_badge.py` generates `coverage.json` for a self-hosted shields.io endpoint badge (no Codecov account required).
- **Docker**: multi-stage `Dockerfile` (deps → runtime), `docker-compose.yml` with healthcheck and persistent `./data` volume, `.dockerignore`, `.env.example` documenting every env var. `app/config.py` learned to read `.env` without adding a dependency.
- **Repo hygiene**: `.gitattributes` enforces LF line endings; extended `.gitignore` for `.env`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `coverage.xml`, `dist/`, `build/`.

### Bug fixes
- **CV upload preference key mismatch** (`/api/upload-cv`): the handler checked `summary.get("ruoli_preferiti")` but both the LLM prompt and the heuristic returned `preferred_roles`, so the per-user roles preference was never persisted on upload. Now reads and writes `preferred_roles`.
- **CV content validation**: `validate_cv_content()` rejects uploads under 200 chars or missing common CV keywords (HTTP 422), preventing junk PDFs from polluting the profile store.
- **CV upload deduplication**: migration `003_candidate_profile_hash.py` adds `content_hash` + index; re-uploading the same file now returns the existing `profile_id` instead of creating a duplicate row.
- **Bundle: missing `tls_client` DLL**: `JobFinder.spec` now `collect_data_files("tls_client")` so jobspy's TLS native lib (`tls-client-64.dll`) ships with the executable. Without this fix the EXE crashed at first scrape import with `FileNotFoundError`.
- **Bundle: migrations not discovered**: `app/migrations/*.py` added to spec `datas`; `pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__)` requires real files on disk (the PYZ-only inclusion via `collect_submodules` is not enough), so previous bundles raised `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: preferences` on first launch.
- **Bundle: `web/` static dir not found**: `create_app` now resolves `web_dir` from `sys._MEIPASS` when frozen (PyInstaller). Workspace dir holds only user-writable state (`data/`, `.env`, `cv.md`); read-only assets live inside the bundle.

### Refactor
- `web/app.js`: extracted i18n into `web/modules/i18n.js` with a `onLanguageChange` callback registry, dropping ~80 LOC from the main entry. Chat / scan / kanban / recommendations splits remain on the follow-up list.

### Docs
- README slimmed to 4 demo screenshots, accurate test count (122) and i18n key count (259), refreshed Project structure tree, new Rate limiting and Database migrations sections, expanded Mermaid architecture diagram (rate_limit, migrations, roles_shortlist, chat memory).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `Makefile` added; `DOCS/schema.md` and `DOCS/security.md` tracked and linked from README.
- New `tests/e2e/readme-demo-gif.spec.js` records an animated hero GIF via Playwright + ffmpeg (run via `npm run record-demo`).
- Empty `tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.js` deleted; `readme-cv-showcase.spec.js` renamed to `manual-cv-flow.spec.js` and restricted to the Italian CV.

### Standalone Windows bundle
- `scripts/launch_exe.py`: PyInstaller entry point. Resolves a writable workspace next to the executable, sets `JOBFINDER_WORKSPACE` before importing `app.main`, opens the default browser when uvicorn is ready, runs without `reload`.
- `JobFinder.spec`: PyInstaller config with two analyses (`launch_exe` → `JobFinder.exe`, `updater` → `Updater.exe`) merged via `MERGE` so dependencies are stored once. Hidden imports cover `pkgutil`-discovered submodules (`app.migrations`, `app.providers`) and the LLM SDKs imported lazily inside try/except.
- `scripts/build_exe.py` + `make build-exe`: idempotent local build that wipes `build/`, runs PyInstaller, and zips `dist/JobFinder/` into `dist/JobFinder-windows.zip`.
- **Banner signup links**: the no-API-key sticky banner now renders three CTAs (Cerebras free key, Groq key, Open Settings) so a non-developer can register in 30 s without reading docs. 4 new i18n keys × 5 locales (`banner.signupHint`, `signupCerebras`, `signupGroq`, `openSettings`).
- **README "For non-developers (Windows)"**: 5-step download → extract → run → register → paste-key flow, plus SmartScreen workaround. New shields.io release badge linking to the latest GitHub release.
- **CI release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): on tag `v*` push, runs `python scripts/build_exe.py` on `windows-latest` and uploads `JobFinder-windows.zip` as a release asset (auto-generated notes). `workflow_dispatch` trigger uploads it as an artifact instead, for dry runs.

### Self-update (standalone bundle)
- `app/update_sync.py`: `sync_install_dir(source, target)` copies a freshly-extracted bundle over the install dir, skipping any path whose first component is `data`, `.env`, or `.env.local`. User DB, secrets, settings, and logs are guaranteed to survive every update.
- `scripts/updater.py` (bundled as `Updater.exe`): waits for the parent JobFinder PID to exit (Windows `OpenProcess` / POSIX `os.kill(pid, 0)`), downloads the latest `*windows.zip` asset from GitHub Releases, extracts to a temp dir, runs the sync, restarts JobFinder.exe. Every step logged to `data/logs/updater.log`. Failures leave the install dir untouched.
- `POST /api/update/start` (`app/main.py`): refuses with 409 in dev mode or when already on latest, refuses with 500 if `Updater.exe` is missing. On success, spawns the updater detached and schedules `os._exit(0)` 0.8 s later so the response flushes and files unlock.
- `app/version.py:get_version_info` reports `frozen: bool` so the frontend picks the right update flow.
- Frontend update banner branches on `info.frozen`: bundle users see a progress modal that polls `/api/health` every 2 s, detects the file-replacement outage window, and auto-reloads the page when the new process answers. Dev users keep the existing `git pull && pip install` flow.
- 6 new unit tests (`tests/unit/test_update_sync.py`) cover: data dir survives, app/ files are replaced, brand new files land, `.env` stays put, source `data/` subtree is ignored, missing source raises.
