"""When to look at the mailbox, and what to do with what is found.

The expensive question is not "is this a confirmation" but "which offer is it
about", and the answer comes from something the app already knows: which
postings the user opened, and when. That turns a search through a whole mailbox
into a check on the four companies opened this week.

Three behaviours here are decisions, not implementation details:

* **A connected mailbox gets read.** This used to say "nothing pending, nothing
  fetched": with no offer whose link had been opened from inside the app, the
  tick returned ``idle`` without opening a connection. The intention was
  restraint; the effect was an off switch, because that flag is set by a gesture
  — pressing an offer's link in Job Finder — that someone who applies on
  LinkedIn never makes. Confirmations then piled up unread until a historic
  sweep was run by hand. Now a configured, enabled account is looked at, over
  the pending-days window, and a message that records an application to a
  company the archive never saw becomes a proposal instead of nothing.
  A periodic connection is still kept deliberately when there is truly nothing
  to do: a Microsoft refresh token expires after about 90 days of inactivity.
* **The last-run stamp is written even when the run failed.** Learned the
  expensive way in ``autoscan``: without it, a mailbox that cannot be reached is
  retried every single tick, forever.
* **A dry run is a first-class mode.** How well the rules actually do is unknown
  until they meet a real mailbox, so they can be pointed at one and made to
  report what they *would* have marked, with nothing written.
