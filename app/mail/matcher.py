"""Is this message a confirmation that I applied, and to which posting?

Pure functions: no network, no database, no model. Every decision is a regex
table or a company-name comparison, and the rule that fired is carried in the
result so a wrong answer can be explained from the database alone, without ever
storing the message.

**Why no model.** It would need the subject and probably the body, which means
sending someone's mail to a third party — a line this app crosses only for a
redacted CV, and only for the CV. The redactor in ``app.services.pii`` is tuned
for CV prose and would not make an email safe. And the L. 68/99 case already
taught this project what plausible-guessing on weak evidence does at scale: 29
postings in a real archive cite the law and exactly ONE is reserved. A detector
that fires on all of them is the problem, not the data. Here the cost of being
wrong is higher still, because this WRITES to the record of what you applied
for. If recall turns out to be poor, the way out is more patterns the user can
see and correct, not a model.

**The shape of the rule.** Two independent facts must agree: the subject has to
read like a confirmation AND the sender has to be either a known applicant
tracking system or the company the user actually opened. Subject alone catches
every job alert; sender alone catches every LinkedIn notification, including
"three people viewed your profile".
