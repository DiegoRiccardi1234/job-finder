"""What to search for, and where — resolved from what the user has.

Until 2.0.0 an empty search form did not mean "I have not said yet": it meant
"use the six terms and the city that the person who wrote this app was looking
for". The consequences went further than one odd scan, because the resolved
values are then stored as ``last_scan_*``, which the scheduler replays and
which the work-rule inference reads as evidence of where the user lives. One
scan with an empty form and a stranger's install believed they were an AI QA
engineer in Turin.

So the fallbacks now come from the user's own data, in order of how recently
they said it, and the chain ends in nothing at all. Nothing is a valid answer:
the caller is expected to ask rather than to guess.
