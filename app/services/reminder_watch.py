"""Telling the user a reminder came due, instead of waiting to be looked at.

Reminders worked: you could set one, and the Dashboard listed it with an
"overdue" badge. That is the whole of it — nothing ever announced one. A reminder
you have to remember to go and read is a note, not a reminder, and the point of
setting one is precisely that you will be thinking about something else.

The channel already exists and is already used: ``app.notify`` bridges the
system tray, and the auto-scan scheduler fires through it when a scan finds
something. This rides the same once-a-minute tick, for the same reason that one
does — a second thread to check a SQLite table once a minute would be a thread
that spends its life asleep.

Two rules keep it from becoming noise:

* **Each reminder is announced once.** The job id and its due date go into a
  preference, so changing the date announces it again and leaving it alone does
  not. Without that, "overdue" is true forever and the tray fires every minute.
* **It is opt-in**, like the auto-scan notification next to it. Someone who does
  not want their afternoon interrupted turns it off and still keeps the list.
