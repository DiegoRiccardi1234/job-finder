"""What the app still needs to know before it can search for you.

Two questions are answered here, and they are different. "Can a scan run at
all?" has exactly two requirements — what to search for and where — because
without them the only thing left to search with is somebody else's profile.
"Will the results be any good?" has many more, and none of them blocks: an
unknown fact never hides an offer (see ``candidate_facts``), it just stops
being able to rule one out.

The per-fact provenance already existed and nothing read it: ``matching-facts``
has answered with ``sources`` (cv / manuale / mancante) and a ``missing`` list
since 1.8.0, and the frontend rendered three rows of it. This is that idea
finished — one place that knows what is missing, so the profile page, the
dashboard checklist and the pre-scan gate cannot disagree.
