"""The few facts about the candidate that decide whether an offer is applicable.

Years of experience, degree level, degree grade and where they can actually
work. All four already existed somewhere — ``summary_json`` carries the first
two, the CV text carries the grade, ``onboarding_work_mode`` carries the last —
and none of them was read by the scoring path. An offer demanding two years, or
a master's, or presence in another city could score 9.

Three rules hold everywhere in this module:

* **Nothing is hardcoded for one person.** Every fact comes from the CV the user
  uploaded or from a field they filled in.
* **A manual correction always wins.** CV parsers misread dates and degrees, so
  the user must be able to overrule them, and the correction must survive
  re-uploading the CV.
* **An unknown fact blocks nothing.** If we cannot tell how many years someone
  has, the experience check stays silent rather than hiding real jobs.
