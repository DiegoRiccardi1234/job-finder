        retention is there to stop the list silting up with the mediocre, and it
        was filing away the best just as readily. Two things make that worse than
        it sounds. The threshold sits one day from the scraping window
        (``hours_old``, 14 days), so an offer is archived almost exactly when it
        becomes impossible to re-find — which is not the same fact as being
        closed. And the score is the only reason the user would ever have looked.

        Measured on a real archive: of six high scorers it had filed away, the
        user opened each one and four were still live, two of them applications
        he had already sent. The floor would have protected 11 of 208.

        The cost, stated rather than hidden: an expired offer scoring at or above
        the floor now stays in the list until someone archives it by hand.
