"""File-sync primitive used by the standalone updater.

Copies every file from a freshly-extracted bundle directory into the
install directory, skipping a small whitelist of user-owned paths
(``data/``, ``.env``, ``.env.local``). The point is that the SQLite
DB, uploaded CV, API keys, and any environment overrides survive an
update untouched.

This module is import-clean (no side effects) so the unit tests can
exercise ``sync_install_dir`` without going through the rest of the
binary.
