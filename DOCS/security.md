# Security Notes

Job Finder is designed as a **localhost-only** app. Do not expose it on a public network without adding real auth.

## Secret storage

- LLM API keys are stored in SQLite (`preferences` table) and in `data/local_secrets.json` — **plaintext**. This is acceptable for single-user localhost use on a trusted machine; it is **not** safe on shared systems or cloud VMs.
- To move to an encrypted store, integrate OS keyring (e.g. `keyring` PyPI) and migrate `save_local_provider_keys` accordingly.

## Network surface

- Uvicorn default binds `127.0.0.1:8000`. Never bind `0.0.0.0` without adding authentication.
- Scraping targets (LinkedIn, Indeed) are called directly from your IP. Excessive scans can trigger a ban. Fase 9 adds request pacing (0.8–2.4s between terms) and a canary that detects unexpected empty results.

## Request-side protections

- **Rate limiting** (`app/rate_limit.py`): sliding window per IP+bucket. Defaults:
  - `/api/chat` — 20 req/min
  - `/api/scan` — 5 req/min
  - `/api/upload-cv` — 10 req/min
  Disable for tests with `ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT=0`.
- **CV upload** validates extension (`.pdf/.docx/.md/.txt`) and size (5 MB cap).
- **Chat markdown renderer** always `escapeHtml`s content before applying minimal markdown transforms; no untrusted HTML reaches the DOM.

## Known risks

- Plaintext key storage (see above).
- No CSRF protection — localhost usage assumption.
- Scraper output is LLM-consumed; malicious listing descriptions could attempt prompt injection. Current system prompt asks the model to strictly output JSON; further hardening (input sanitization, prompt injection detection) is a future enhancement.
