> A localhost-first AI-powered job search assistant. Scrape LinkedIn & Indeed, score offers against your CV with the LLM of your choice, and plan applications from a single dashboard.

---

## Why this project

I built Job Finder while preparing my own transition into IT. Existing job boards push generic listings and waste hours on roles that don't fit. I wanted a tool that:

- knows my CV and preferences,
- scrapes real listings,
- ranks them with an LLM I control,
- and keeps everything **on my machine** — no third-party dashboard owns my data.

The result is a portfolio-grade FastAPI app with a multi-provider LLM backbone, a chat-driven UX, and an honest fallback when the network or the model is down.

---

## Features

- **Smart CV analysis** — Upload PDF / DOCX / TXT; the LLM extracts skills, seniority, and ideal roles.
- **AI Career Coach** — Chat that learns your preferences, suggests search terms, and can autofill the scan form via structured `action` payloads.
- **Multi-source scan** — LinkedIn + Indeed in parallel, streamed via Server-Sent Events.
- **Personalized scoring** — Each job gets a 1-10 AI score with pros/cons and an apply/skip recommendation.
- **Kanban tracking** — Open → Applied → Interviewing → Rejected.
- **Cover-letter generator** — One-click, tailored to the job and your CV.
- **Multilingual UI** — English, Italian, Spanish, French, German (204 keys per locale, 100% parity).
- **Multi-LLM fallback** — Cerebras, Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter — configurable order.
- **Resilient by default** — Structured logging, no silent `except Exception`, WAL-mode SQLite, file size + MIME validation on uploads.

## Demo

**Dashboard** — personalized hero, live analytics, and an always-on AI Career Coach in the right rail.

**Job Search wizard** — guided 3-step flow: analyze your CV, pick target roles from AI-suggested chips, launch the scan.

![Job Search](screenshots/readme/job-search-en.png)

> 🎯 Step 1 reads your active CV and surfaces matching role suggestions as clickable chips.
> ✨ Dark mode is included — one-click toggle in the top bar.

**AI Career Coach chat** — ask questions in plain language; the coach suggests target roles as clickable pills and can auto-fill the scan form.

**Live scan progress** — during a scan you see each portal scraped, every job analyzed, and its score (green/yellow/red) in a live feed. Minimize it to keep browsing.

The chat service is split into single-responsibility modules:
`state` (chat state machine + preference extraction) ·
`context` (profile / preferences / jobs context blocks) ·
`prompts` (templates loaded from `app/prompts/chat/*.txt`) ·
`intents` (search / role-guidance heuristics) ·
`fallback` (rule-based answer when no LLM is available) ·
`handler` (orchestration + JSON-envelope parsing).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- At least one LLM API key (any of the 6 supported providers)
- Node.js (optional — only for Playwright E2E)

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiegoRiccardi1234/Linkedin-searcher.git
cd Linkedin-searcher

python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_webapp.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.

### First-time setup

1. Open **Settings** and paste at least one LLM API key.
2. Upload your CV (PDF / DOCX / TXT, max 5 MB).
3. Chat with the AI Coach — it will ask about preferences.
4. Run a job scan from Settings (or let the chatbot pre-fill the form).
5. Review the dashboard and move jobs through the Kanban board.

## Localhost ≠ offline

The app runs entirely on your machine, but some features need internet:

| Works without internet | Requires internet |
|-------|-----------|
| UI navigation, filters, Kanban | Job scraping (LinkedIn / Indeed) |
| Local SQLite data | LLM chat / coaching |
| Existing scored jobs | AI scoring of newly scraped jobs |
| Manual status changes | Cover-letter generation |
| CSV export | Provider health checks |

When offline, online features fail gracefully and fall back to rule-based answers.

---

## Supported LLM providers

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Single key, hundreds of models (Claude 4.x, GPT-5, Llama 4, Qwen 3, DeepSeek...) |
| **Cerebras** | Llama 4 Scout / Maverick, Qwen 3 235B — sub-second inference, free tier |
| **Groq** | Llama 4, Qwen 3, Kimi K2, DeepSeek — ultra-low latency |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, o4-mini, o3 |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash |

The `ProviderManager` picks the first available provider from your configured order, logs the choice, and exposes a `metadata()` endpoint for the UI status badge.

---

## API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health + provider/key status |
| POST | `/api/upload-cv` | Upload CV (size + MIME validated) |
| GET | `/api/profile` | Active candidate profile |
| GET | `/api/scan/stream` | SSE-streamed job scan |
| GET | `/api/jobs` | List jobs with filters |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{id}` | Job detail + AI analysis |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{id}/cover-letter` | Generate cover letter |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{id}/action` | Set status (apply/skip/archive) |
| POST | `/api/chat` | Chat with AI Career Coach |
| GET | `/api/analytics` | Dashboard stats |
| GET | `/api/recommendations` | Top AI-recommended jobs |

---

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, no network, no SDK dependencies)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest

# i18n coverage audit
python scripts/check_i18n.py

# E2E (browser)
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

The unit suite uses a `FakeProviderManager` fixture so it runs without any LLM API key.

---

## Logging

Logging is configured once in `AppContainer.__init__`. Output goes to stderr **and** to a rotating log file at `data/logs/app.log` (1 MB × 3 backups). Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see provider selection details.

```
2026-04-22 22:08:43 | INFO    | app.main              | AppContainer initializing
2026-04-22 22:08:48 | INFO    | app.providers.factory | LLM provider active: openrouter (model=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6)
2026-04-22 22:09:01 | WARNING | app.services.scanner_service | scrape_jobs failed (term='QA Tester'): TimeoutError
```

---

## Local data

Everything lives in `data/`:
- `searcher.db` — SQLite (WAL journal mode)
- `local_secrets.json` — provider API keys (gitignored)
- `settings.json` — user preferences
- `logs/app.log` — rotating application log

Back up the `data/` folder before major updates.
